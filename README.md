# SmartCity
This mini project will include simulated components for smart traffic management, smart lighting, and environmental monitoring. You can expand and customize it according to your needs.
Here's a high-level overview of the project structure:

Here's a breakdown of the components:

SmartCitySimulation.java: The main class of the simulation that starts and manages the different aspects of the smart city simulation.

TrafficManagement.java: Simulates smart traffic management, including traffic lights, congestion detection, and rerouting of vehicles. You can use a CSV file (traffic_data.csv) to represent traffic data.

SmartLighting.java: Simulates smart lighting in the city, where street lights adjust their brightness based on the time of day and sensor data.

EnvironmentalMonitoring.java: Simulates environmental monitoring, including air quality, noise levels, and temperature.

traffic_data.csv: A sample data file for simulating traffic data. You can expand this to include more complex traffic data.

opencsv-5.5.2.jar: The OpenCSV library for reading and writing CSV files. You'll need to add this library to your project to handle the traffic data CSV file.

here is simplified implementation
```
// SmartCitySimulation.java
public class SmartCitySimulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrafficManagement trafficManagement = new TrafficManagement();
        SmartLighting smartLighting = new SmartLighting();
        EnvironmentalMonitoring environmentalMonitoring = new EnvironmentalMonitoring();

        // Start simulation components
        trafficManagement.start();
        smartLighting.start();
        environmentalMonitoring.start();
    }
}

// TrafficManagement.java
public class TrafficManagement {
    public void start() {
        // Implement traffic management logic
        // Read traffic data from CSV, control traffic lights, etc.
    }
}

// SmartLighting.java
public class SmartLighting {
    public void start() {
        // Implement smart lighting logic
        // Adjust street light brightness based on sensor data and time of day
    }
}

// EnvironmentalMonitoring.java
public class EnvironmentalMonitoring {
    public void start() {
        // Implement environmental monitoring logic
        // Monitor air quality, noise levels, temperature, etc.
    }
}

```
You'll need to add logic to read and process the data from the CSV file, simulate traffic flow, control street lights, and monitor environmental conditions based on your specific requirements.
