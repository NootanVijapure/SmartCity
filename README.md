# SmartCity
This mini project will include simulated components for smart traffic management, smart lighting, and environmental monitoring. You can expand and customize it according to your needs.
Here's a high-level overview of the project structure:

Here's a breakdown of the components:

SmartCitySimulation.java: The main class of the simulation that starts and manages the different aspects of the smart city simulation.

TrafficManagement.java: Simulates smart traffic management, including traffic lights, congestion detection, and rerouting of vehicles. You can use a CSV file (traffic_data.csv) to represent traffic data.

SmartLighting.java: Simulates smart lighting in the city, where street lights adjust their brightness based on the time of day and sensor data.

EnvironmentalMonitoring.java: Simulates environmental monitoring, including air quality, noise levels, and temperature.

traffic_data.csv: A sample data file for simulating traffic data. You can expand this to include more complex traffic data.

opencsv-5.5.2.jar: The OpenCSV library for reading and writing CSV files. You'll need to add this library to your project to handle the traffic data CSV file.

here is simplified implementation
```
public class SmartCitySimulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrafficManagement trafficManagement = new TrafficManagement();
        SmartLighting smartLighting = new SmartLighting();
        EnvironmentalMonitoring environmentalMonitoring = new EnvironmentalMonitoring();

        // Start simulation components using multithreading
        Thread trafficThread = new Thread(trafficManagement);
        Thread lightingThread = new Thread(smartLighting);
        Thread monitoringThread = new Thread(environmentalMonitoring);

        trafficThread.start();
        lightingThread.start();
        monitoringThread.start();

        // Add exception handling for each component
        try {
            trafficThread.join();
            lightingThread.join();
            monitoringThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


```
You'll need to add logic to read and process the data from the CSV file, simulate traffic flow, control street lights, and monitor environmental conditions based on your specific requirements.

1. TrafficManagement.java: Simulates smart traffic management, including traffic lights, congestion detection, and rerouting of vehicles. It will demonstrate collections and input/output for reading data from a CSV file.
```
   import java.util.List;

public class TrafficManagement implements Runnable {
    private List<Vehicle> vehicles;

    public void run() {
        // Read traffic data from CSV
        // Implement traffic management logic using collections
        // Handle exceptions for I/O operations
    }
}
```

2. SmartLighting.java: Simulates smart lighting in the city, where street lights adjust their brightness based on the time of day and sensor data. It will demonstrate time handling.
 ```

```
4. EnvironmentalMonitoring.java: Simulates environmental monitoring, including air quality, noise levels, and temperature. It will demonstrate loops and time handling.
```
```
5.  Vehicle.java: Represents a vehicle in the simulation
```
```
7.  Sensor.java: Represents a sensor used for environmental monitoring
   import java.util.Random;
```
public class Sensor {
    private String sensorType;
    private double currentValue;

    public Sensor(String sensorType) {
        this.sensorType = sensorType;
        this.currentValue = 0.0;
    }

    public void measure() {
        // Simulate measuring data by generating random values
        Random rand = new Random();

        if ("Air Quality".equals(sensorType)) {
            currentValue = rand.nextDouble() * 100; // Random value between 0 and 100
        } else if ("Noise Level".equals(sensorType)) {
            currentValue = rand.nextDouble() * 120; // Random value between 0 and 120 (in decibels)
        } else if ("Temperature".equals(sensorType)) {
            currentValue = rand.nextDouble() * 40 - 10; // Random value between -10 and 30 degrees Celsius
        }
    }

    public double getCurrentValue() {
        return currentValue;
    }

    public String getSensorType() {
        return sensorType;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Sensor Type: " + sensorType + ", Current Value: " + currentValue;
    }
}
```
